Task 6 - Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength
===========================================================

Procedure:
1. Create at least 4-5 passwords of varying strengths (weak, medium, strong, very strong).
2. Include variations in:
   - Uppercase letters (A-Z)
   - Lowercase letters (a-z)
   - Numbers (0-9)
   - Symbols (!, @, #, $, %, etc.)
   - Length (8 to 16+ characters)
3. Visit an online password strength checker:
   - https://passwordmeter.com/
   - https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/
4. Enter each password into the tool (do NOT use your real passwords).
5. Record:
   - Strength score or percentage.
   - Estimated time to crack.
   - Feedback from the tool.
6. Compare results to understand what makes passwords strong or weak.
7. Research common password attacks (brute force, dictionary attack, phishing).
8. Write best practices for creating strong passwords.
9. Save your test results and findings in a report.
10. Upload procedure.txt, readme.txt, and report.txt to your GitHub repository.
